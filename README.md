# libllpc
Library for low-level construction in C programming language. Also my first Linux library, donâ€™t take it harsh.

## What do the header files do?
hexdefs.h: Unused. Defines Assembly machine code types into simpler types.
protectedtools.h: Contains simple tools for protected mode.
gdttools.h: VERY experimental. Contains functions for GDT.
multiboottools.h: Contains tools to set up basic stack and multiboot.
